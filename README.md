“Oden: The Sight of the Meme. 

Tired of endless scrolling, chasing fleeting trends? I, Oden, have seen countless cycles, and I’ve learned one simple truth: the best memes are born from understanding.  

Oden is my gift to you – a clever engine built to capture the spirit of a moment. Simply feed it images, and I will gaze upon them, deciphering their essence. I’ll craft precise tags, linking them to the very heart of the meme. Need a laugh? Just ask, and I’ll find the echoes of similar images, weaving them into something new, something bright.  

Don’t just seek a meme—receive one. Oden is the sight of the meme – amplified by intelligence. “
